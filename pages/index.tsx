      <p>
        We have 4 different themes (will have different channels for each and
        the idea is to read one book a month):
      </p>
      <ol className="my-2">
        <li>
          1. <span className="font-semibold">adulting</span> - anything that you
          know will help you somehow, like atomic habits, the defining decade,
          becoming, lean in, educated, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. <span className="font-semibold">escape</span> - classic
          fiction/scifi go here
        </li>
        <li>
          3. <span className="font-semibold">fun</span> - children's literature,
          graphic novels, humor books{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          4. <span className="font-semibold">curiosity</span> - this is for avid
          readers, picking up an out of comfort zone book, different opinion,
          long/academic books like architecture books, game design, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'd recommend to pick only 1 for now (thinking to put some monetary
        friction to join multiple clubs at the same time).
